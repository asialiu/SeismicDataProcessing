This is a work in progress designed originally to build layered models for 
the oiink project.  Later (April 2014) realized this could be generalized
to be more generally useful.  In particular, I want to use some of the 
pieces of this to build a CRUST1.0 interface.   Would want to use this
for USArray data to compute statics and for 1d modeling.
